# Robot Manipulation
*also closely-related to `Artificial General Intelligence`, `Embodied Artificial Intelligence` and `Embodiment of AI`*

This is a mixed collection of many different fields including `Dexterous Hand Grasp`, `Human Object Interaction`, `Deep Generative Framework`,  `Large Language Model`, `Vision Language Pretraining` and `Vision Language Action`. We assume that all of these fields will have a quite close and also positive impact in the final goal `Robot Manipulation`.
