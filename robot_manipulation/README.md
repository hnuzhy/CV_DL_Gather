This is a mixed collection of many different fields including `Dexterous Hand Grasp`, `Human Object Interaction`, `Deep Generative Framework`,  `Large Language Model`, and `Vision Language Model`. We assume that all of these fields will have a quite close and also positive impact in the final goal `Robot Manipulation`.
