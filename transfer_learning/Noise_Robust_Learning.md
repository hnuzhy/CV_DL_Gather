by [`curriculum learning` (ICML2009, Yoshua Bengio)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1553374.1553380) (also see [Self-Paced Learning for Latent Variable Models (NIPS2010)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2010/hash/e57c6b956a6521b28495f2886ca0977a-Abstract.html) wherein easiness is decided upon based on how small the loss values are.) and can be thought of as a way to design an `adaptive curriculum`.][The core selection strategy is choosing a threshold in each mini-batch by calaulating `mean + 1*var` (super easy!!!)][tested on datasets `MNIST`, `CIFAR10` and `Clothing-1M`, where the Label Noise is manually made with a given `noisy rate`!!! (not realistic datasets with noisy labels!!!)(except the `Clothing-1M`)]
