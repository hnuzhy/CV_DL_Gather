## 1) Introduction
DarkPose(DARK means Distribution-Aware coordinate Representation of Keypoint) is from paper named **Distribution-Aware Coordinate Representation for Human Pose Estimation**. It's not a new independent pose estimation algorithm but serving as a plug-in that is attached to a variety of other algorithms. This work fills the gap by studying the coordinate representation with a particular focus on the heatmap. Refer to the figure below. We will explain the details of this paper later.
