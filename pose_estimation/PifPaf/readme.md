## 1) Introduction

Paper Name: `PifPaf - Composite Fields for Human Pose Estimation`. PifPaf uses a *Part Intensity Field (PIF)* to localize body parts and a *Part Association Field (PAF)* to associate body parts with each other to form full human poses. This new bottom-up method outperforms previous methods at low resolution and in crowded, cluttered and occluded scenes. These characteristics are very suitable for our classroom application.
