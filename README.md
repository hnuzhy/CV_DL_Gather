# Action Recognition
Action recognition is to classify short video clips that have been pre-segmented (Actually, videos in real environments are generally not pre-segmented and contain a lot of irrelevant information).

The category of action recognition is usually all kinds of human actions, so it can also be called **Human Action Recognition**. However, most of the algorithms developed based on this problem are not specific to people, and can also be used for other types of video classification. In addition, the task of action recognition generally does not include the problem of **Temporal Action Detection** in videos. *Refer to branch [action_recognition](./action_recognition) for detailed introduction.*

# Pose Estimation
Given a 2D RGB image, the traditional task of pose estimation is to predict and output all the keypoints of human bodies contained in it, and connect them into independent skeletons.

On this basis, there are other pose estimation tasks under different types of input. Such as **3D Pose Estimation** (RGBD), video based **Pose Estimation and Tracking** (videos), **WiFi Reflection Based Pose Estimation** (WiFi info) and **Human Body Pose and Shape Estimation** (3D motion data). Pose estimation can be used not only for practical applications directly, but also to tackle other computer vision tasks. *Refer to branch [pose_estimation](./pose_estimation) for detailed introduction.*
